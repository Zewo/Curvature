**HTTP** provides HTTP [(RFC 2616)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) request/response entities for **Swift 2**.

## Features

- [x] No `Foundation` dependency (**Linux ready**)

## Usage

```swift
import HTTP
import URI

let request = HTTPRequest(method: .GET, uri: URI(path: "/"))
let response = HTTPResponse(status: .OK)
```

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 0.39.0+ is required to build HTTP.

To integrate **HTTP** into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/Zewo/Specs.git'
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
use_frameworks!

pod 'HTTP', '0.1'
```
> Don't forget  `source 'https://github.com/Zewo/Specs.git'`. This is very important. It should always come before the official CocoaPods repo.

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate **HTTP** into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "Zewo/HTTP" == 0.1
```

### Command Line Application

To use **HTTP** in a command line application:

- Install the [Swift Command Line Application](https://github.com/Zewo/Swift-Command-Line-Application-Template) Xcode template
- Follow [Cocoa Pods](#cocoapods) or [Carthage](#carthage) instructions.
